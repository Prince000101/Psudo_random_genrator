# Novelty PRNG: A Pseudo-Random Number Generator
![Live Randomness Analysis Dashboard](assets/dashboard.png)
An experimental pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) that uses environmental inputs like memory addresses, high-precision timestamps, and live weather data to generate digits from 0-9. This project began as a quest for "true randomness" and evolved into a fascinating exploration of what makes a number sequence appear random.

## The Idea: A Quest for True Randomness

My initial goal was to create a "truly" random number generator. The idea was to use unpredictable, real-world data:

1.  Create a temporary variable in Python.
2.  Capture its memory address (a "pointer"), which is unpredictable.
3.  Use the last digit of this address to select a city from a predefined list.
4.  Fetch live weather data for that city using an API.
5.  Combine the temperature, the weather data's memory address, and a high-precision timestamp into a single large number.
6.  Derive a final 0-9 digit from this sum using modulo arithmetic.

The combination of chaotic inputs—memory allocation, network latency, and live atmospheric data—seemed like a perfect recipe for true randomness.

## The Discovery: True Random vs. Pseudo-Random

Halfway through, I began reading articles on the topic and realized that what I was building was not a "true" random number generator, but a very creative **pseudo-random number generator (PRNG)**.

  * **True Randomness** is generated from unpredictable physical phenomena, like atmospheric noise or radioactive decay. It is **non-deterministic**, meaning it's impossible to reproduce the same sequence of numbers again.
  * **Pseudo-Randomness** is generated by a mathematical algorithm. It is **deterministic**—if you start with the same initial value (a "seed"), you will always get the exact same sequence of numbers. While they appear random, they are fundamentally predictable.

My project is a unique PRNG because its "seed" is a combination of chaotic environmental factors that are nearly impossible to reproduce, thus creating a non-repeatable sequence. However, it's still driven by a deterministic algorithm.

## Libraries & Dependencies

This project uses the following Python libraries to function:

  * **`requests`**: To make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
  * **`matplotlib`**: To create the live-updating dashboard that visualizes the randomness of the generated numbers.

## Visualizing the Randomness

To see if the generator was producing a good distribution, I used `matplotlib` to create a live dashboard with two plots:

1.  **Line Plot**: Shows the sequence of generated numbers over time. A good generator should produce a chaotic, static-like line with no repeating patterns.
2.  **Histogram**: Shows the frequency of each digit (0-9). For the sequence to be considered random, every digit should appear roughly 10% of the time, causing all bars to approach the same height.

Remarkably, in testing, the generator showed no obvious visual patterns and produced a fairly uniform distribution, confirming it's a high-quality (and very fun) PRNG.

## How to Run

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Install the required libraries: `pip install requests matplotlib`
3.  Get a free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
4.  Paste your API key into the `API_KEY` variable in the script.
5.  Run the script: `python your_script_name.py`
